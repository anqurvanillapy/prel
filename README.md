# preldb

*pre-relational database*

**Notice:** code for learning, not for production use.

A simple JavaScript rewrite of [dbm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbm). But
actually started with the slow but simple version of `dbm` -
[dbm.dumb](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/dbm/dumb.py), which is
written in Python.
